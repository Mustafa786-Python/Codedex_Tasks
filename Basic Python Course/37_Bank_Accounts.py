"""
It's time to open up a bank account! 🏦

Create a file called bank_accounts.py.

Let's define a BankAccount class. Then, let's use the __init__() method to set the following attributes:

first_name (string)
last_name (string)
account_id (integer)
account_type (string)
pin (integer)
balance (float)
Next, let's create three methods:

.deposit(): Add money into the account and return the new balance.
.withdraw(): Take money out by subtracting from balance and returning the withdrawn amount.
.display_balance(): Print the current value of balance.
Lastly, initialize a new object from the BankAccount class and use these methods to do the following:

Deposit $96 into the account.
Withdraw $25 from the account.
Print the current account balance.
